# CPSC-353-Stenography

# This program can store and read text hidden in an image starting from the bottom right pixel.
# This is done by storing the length of the text in bits in the last eleven pixels
# and the text in the remaining pixels.
# The text will be written from the bottom right-most corner (starting with the 12th to last pixel) to the
# top left-most corner.

# As of April 25, 2018 10:27 am: the decode function works properly
